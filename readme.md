**Overview**

The script takes a list of paths from a .txt file and the uses these paths to make a new version of the User's Manual.

**File**

The file is supposed to be named 'variables.txt' and placed on the 'C:' volume (Windows).

**Example**

The contents of the file are supposed to consists of the following lines, i.e.

*C:\\Builds\30594* <br>
*D:\pa_config* <br>
*D:\gitbash\help* <br>

The order of lines is important! Thus, the first line represents a path to a build, the second one must follow to the commercial licenses list header file, while the second must lead to the User's Manual repository where the main script is given.
