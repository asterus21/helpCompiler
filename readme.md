# **Overview**

The script takes a list of paths from a .txt file and then uses these paths to make a new version of the User's Manual.

## **File**

The file is supposed to be named *variables.txt* and placed on the **C:** volume (root).

## **Example**

The contents of the file are supposed to consist of the following lines, i.e.

*C:\\Builds\30594* <br>
*D:\pa_config* <br>
*D:\gitbash\help* <br>

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The order of lines is important!

Thus, the first line represents a path to a build, the second one must follow to the commercial licenses list header file, while the second must lead to the User's Manual repository where the main script is given.
